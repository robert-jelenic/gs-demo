  <p><p>Branding is one of the most common concepts in marketing, but it&rsquo;s also one of the hardest to define. And when you consider branding from a global perspective, it&rsquo;s even far more complex. In fact, there is no universal approach you can take to guarantee a successful global branding strategy. But the value and importance of a company&rsquo;s brand reputation&ndash;and its local voice, no matter where it&rsquo;s heard&ndash;are more than worth the effort involved in building a strong worldwide brand. Join Renato and Michael as they discuss ways global branding has changed in recent years&ndash;and ways it&rsquo;s also returned to its roots.</p>
