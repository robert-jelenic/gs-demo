    <p><p>Roughly 60% of international travelers now book their reservations online. Travelers who don&rsquo;t find what they’re looking for right away are far more likely to become lost opportunities than confirmed reservations. Global travel brands aren’t the only ones feeling the pressure. So are LSPs who provide global travel companies with translations and destination-specific content under tighter and tighter deadlines. John Jimenez, Portfolio Director of e-Commerce at <a href="https://www.interstatehotels.com">Interstate Hotels &amp; Resorts</a>, joins us to discuss how digital marketing has changed the travel industry’s marketing priorities—and what it means for LSPs.</p>
